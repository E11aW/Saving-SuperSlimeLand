# Saving-SuperSlimeLand
 A small-scale game coded in just two weeks!
---
As an extra challenge for myself, I decided to test my knowledge in Java by coding this little game in only two weeks. While the game itself may be a little buggy, but it was a lot of fun to code and taught me a lot more about the language and how to implement a _mostly_ functioning game all on my own! This game tracks the main character as they explore the map, interact with NPCs, bounce along to the game's soundtrack, and work together with new allies to save the world.

There are also a bunch of fun slime designs associated with the base code that I made myself.
