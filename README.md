# Saving-SuperSlimeLand
 A small-scale game coded in two weeks

As an extra challenge for myself, I decided to test my knowledge in Java by coding this little game in only two weeks. It obviously isn't perfect, but it was a lot of fun to code and taught me a lot more about the language and how to implement it!

There are also a bunch of slime designs associated with the base code that I made myself.
